404 - Tools not found

What do a plumber, a electrician and a construction builder have in common? They all are scared of losing they tools.

That's the reason why our prototype has this features:


1) Track the position of every tool ( beacons);

2) Interface by a voice assistant (Google API);

3)Check wether all the items are in the toolbox or not (NFC);

4)Object can produce a loud noise on will to be localized faster;
